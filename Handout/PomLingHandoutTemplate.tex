%MJKD note to future self - this preamble is just the section headers + PomLing formatting, but an ordering paradox between the two files made me combine them and re-order fontspec. *shrug* In future if it needs an update, just take the PomLing formatting file and add in the section headers for handouts.

\section{Introduction}

\begin{itemize}

\item As of January 2021, this handout template contains all the same formatting details/commands as the \href{https://www.overleaf.com/latex/templates/pomona-linguistics-latex-template/bvdxdtpwysnd}{Pomona Linguistics LaTeX template}.

\item If you want to learn how to use LaTeX for Pomona Linguistics, please see the \href{https://www.overleaf.com/latex/templates/pomona-linguistics-quick-reference-guide/jthrqbrktmrd}{Pomona Linguistics Quick Reference Guide}.

\end{itemize}

\subsection{The only change}

The only change between this template and the other ones for Pomona Linguistics is that the section headers are reformatted to look like these. Otherwise the templates use the same packages/commands. Well, this is also 12pt font.

\subsubsection{This is a subsubsection}

It's also gray. But no small caps.
